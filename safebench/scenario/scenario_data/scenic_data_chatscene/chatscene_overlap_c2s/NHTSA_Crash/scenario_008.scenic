'''A stopped vehicle, A, was looking left and right down a cross road waiting for traffic to clear before proceeding. Another driver, B, waiting behind A was also checking crossing traffic. Vehicle A started to go, decided that it wasn't safe, and abruptly stopped. Driver B, who had been watching traffic, thought that A had moved on and proceeded. Driver B rear-ended driver A.'''
