"""Scenario Description:

In a top-down schematic of a four-way intersection, a blue ego vehicle and a pink adversarial vehicle approach the junction side-by-side from the bottom. The blue vehicle is positioned in the left lane and follows a solid blue arrow indicating a straight path through the intersection. Simultaneously, the pink vehicle travels straight ahead in the adjacent right lane, moving parallel to the blue car. Although dashed arrows depict various alternative turning trajectories available from these lanes, the solid arrows highlight that both cars are proceeding forward, with the pink vehicle demonstrating a specific maneuver of staying to the right as it crosses the intersection.
