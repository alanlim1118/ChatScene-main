"""Scenario Description:

At a four-way intersection viewed from above, a green ego vehicle travels straight northward through the junction. Simultaneously, a yellow adversary vehicle enters from the eastern arm and executes a sharp left turn, crossing the center of the intersection. As the green vehicle continues its forward trajectory, the yellow vehicle completes its turn to head south, effectively passing the ego vehicle in the adjacent lane. The scene concludes with the green vehicle exiting the intersection to the north and the yellow vehicle driving southward along the same road, moving away from the junction.
