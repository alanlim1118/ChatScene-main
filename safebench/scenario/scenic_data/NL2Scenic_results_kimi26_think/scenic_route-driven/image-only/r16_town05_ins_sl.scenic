"""Scenario Description:

In a top-down aerial view of a multi-lane urban T-junction, a pink ego vehicle travels straight northbound from the bottom of the frame, approaching an intersection marked by traffic signals and crosswalks. Simultaneously, a blue adversary vehicle approaches from the eastern road on the right, driving westbound before executing a left turn to head southbound. The blue vehicle's path curves across the intersection, directly intersecting the straight trajectory of the northbound ego vehicle and creating a potential collision conflict. The scene is flanked on the left by a railway track and a line of trees, while the right side features residential buildings, a covered parking area, and a grassy park with numerous trees.
