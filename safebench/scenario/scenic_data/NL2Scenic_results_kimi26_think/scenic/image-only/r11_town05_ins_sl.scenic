"""Scenario Description:

The ego vehicle, shown as a red car, travels eastbound from the left side of a multi-lane, four-way urban intersection and attempts a left turn to proceed north, following a pink trajectory path that curves across the junction. This maneuver places the ego vehicle on a collision course with an oncoming blue adversary vehicle traveling straight southbound from the top, as indicated by its straight blue trajectory line. The surrounding environment features a residential complex with white buildings and green lawns in the upper left, a public plaza with a circular fountain in the upper right, a grassy area with trees in the lower left, and a zone with colorful rectangular structures in the lower right, framing the critical interaction where the turning vehicle crosses the path of the straight-moving traffic.
