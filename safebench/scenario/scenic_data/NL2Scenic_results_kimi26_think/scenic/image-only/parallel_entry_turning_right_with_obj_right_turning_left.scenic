"""Scenario Description:

In this top-down traffic scenario, a blue ego vehicle and a pink adversary vehicle begin parallel to each other in the two lanes of the southern arm of a four-way intersection. The blue ego vehicle, positioned in the left lane, executes a right turn as indicated by a blue arrow curving towards the right. Simultaneously, the pink adversary vehicle, located in the right lane, attempts a left turn, with its path marked by a pink arrow curving across the intersection to the left. A conflict arises because the pink vehicle's left-turning path cuts directly across the trajectory of the blue ego vehicle, creating a collision risk as their paths intersect in the middle of the junction.
